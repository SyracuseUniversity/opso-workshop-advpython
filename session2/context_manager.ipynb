    "## Context manager\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager is an object that responds to a `with` statement. It may returns something. The basic idea is that some action is performed when entering a context and again when exiting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "with context as var:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "translates to\n",
    "```\n",
    "# execute context entering code\n",
    "var = return_from_context_entering_code\n",
    "# do something\n",
    "# execute context leaving code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The great advantage here is that the \"leaving code\" is automatically executed whenever we step out of the context!\n",
    "\n",
    "This proved to be incredibly useful when operations have cleanup code that we need to execute yet that is tedious to write manually and can be forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `yield`\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to create a context manager is to have a function that has a `yield`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_What is `yield`?_: It's like a return, except that the execution stops at the `yield`, lets other code execute and, at some point, **continues** again where the yield was. Examples are:\n",
    "- iterator: a function that yields elements. Everytime it is called, it is supposed to yield an element and then continue from there\n",
    "- asynchronous programing: it stops and waits until something else is finished\n",
    "- in the context manager, as we will see"
